# Hyper-Spectral-Image-Classification-Using-CNN

This project aims to develop a hyper-spectral image classification system. The system will take hyper-spectral images as input and classify each pixel into different land cover classes.

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Vishwamadari/Hyper-Spectral-Image-Classification-Using-CNN
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the `Image-Classifier.ipynb` notebook to train and test the hyper-spectral image classification model.
